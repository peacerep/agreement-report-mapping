			<h2>Summarisation</h2>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				Summarisation finds exemplar provisions and sections to represent the topics that peace agreements and implementation reports have in common.

			<h3>Summarisation Algorithm</h3>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				For a given agreement there exists a set implementation reports that follow in time from the agreement. For each agreement-report pair there exists a similarity matrix
				with agreement provisions in rows and report sections in columns. Cells values contain the semantic similarity score of a provision-section pair.
			</p>
			<p>
				For a given agreement, extract from each agreement-report matrix the indices of cells that contain a similarity score 
				at or above a threshold value (0.7 in this demonstration). Also record the cell value. Translate the index values to provision and section IDs. The end
				result is a list of provision-section pairs that are semantically similar at or above the threshold.
			</p>
			<p>
				Use the provision-section pairs to create a pair of connected nodes in a graph (in the network sense). Because some provisions may be paired with more than 
				one section, and some sections may be paired with more than one provision, disjoint subgraphs may form as provision-section pairs join together.
				A disjoint subgraph contain a cluster of semantically related provisions and sections.
				
			</p>
			<p>
				Apply a degree centrality algorithm to all subgraphs in order to provide summarisation of the content of clusters.
				The summary comprises the most salient provision and section of a cluster measured in terms of the number of connections to sections and provisions respectively.
			</p>
			<p>
				Assertions:
				<ol>
					<li>The content of the most salient provision and section represent the topic of a cluster.</li>
					<li>The set of all cluster topics are the topics that an agreement and its following reports have in common.</li>
				</ol>
