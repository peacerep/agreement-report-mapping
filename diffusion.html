				Diffusion tracks summarisation topics across a time series of reports. The diagrams below are representations of a Boolean valued topic-report matrix
				for  the agreement <em>Revitalised Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS)</em>.
				Topics are arranged in order of first appearance in the report sequence. The matrix provide information about:
				<ul>
					<li>Which summarisation topics are mentioned most (row marginals)</li>
					<li>Which reports mention the most summarisation topics (column marginals)</li>
					<li>When a summarisation topic first appears in the report sequence</li>
					<li>Clustering of summarisation topics</li>
				</ul>
				Analysis of matrix row marginals will provide information about which topics are mentioned most, and column marginals information about which reports mention the most topics.
			</p>
			<p>
				The y-axis contains the <a href="./summary_2112.html" target="_blank">162 summarisation topics</a>, and the x-axis the 68 implementation reports that follow the agreement.
				Reports are in date order. In the first diagram the cell values are:
				<ul>
					<li>0 coded as black. The report in the column does not contain the topic in the row. </li>
					<li>1 coded as yellow. The report in the column does contain the topic in the row. </li>
				</ul>
				In the second diagram a dot represents a report containing a topic. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The report at report index 7 is the <em>JMEC-1st-Qtr-2020-Report-FINAL 1</em> which contains 81 of the possible 162 topics.
